# Objectives of the project
This "project" is designed to present Julia's basics, curiosities and specificities. It is not AT ALL a complete view of what is possible to do with this language, but can hopefully be usefull to start to understand the base concepts and, why not, make you chose Julia as your next project language.


# Usefull links
Julia documentation : https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/
Julia dowload page : https://julialang.org/downloads/

# VS Code
If you run it on VS Code, download Julia extension using the extension manager (type julia in the research bar, choose first option)

# How to use this tutorial
The project contains a main.jl file and a Concepts directory.

The main.jl file can be used for rapid testing stuff, but is more or less useless

The Concepts folder contains several julia file presenting different aspects of the language. It is recommended to follow the numbers, as they are indicator of the difficulty of the code inside.

Have fun
